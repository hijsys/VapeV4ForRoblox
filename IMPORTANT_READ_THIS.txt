ü¶¶ OTTER CLIENT - IMPORTANT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS ü¶¶

IF YOU'RE STILL SEEING "VAPE V4" INSTEAD OF "OTTER CLIENT":

YOU MUST DELETE YOUR CACHE FOLDER!

====================
üìÅ DELETE THIS FOLDER:
====================

In your Roblox executor folder, find and DELETE the folder called:
   
   "newvape"

This folder contains old cached files from the original Vape V4.

====================
üîÑ STEPS TO FIX:
====================

1. CLOSE Roblox completely
2. Go to your executor folder
3. Find and DELETE the "newvape" folder
4. Reopen Roblox
5. Execute the loadstring again:

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hijsys/VapeV4ForRoblox/main/NewMainScript.lua", true))()

====================
‚úÖ WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE:
====================

After deleting the cache and reloading, you should see:
- Loading notification: "ü¶¶ Otter Client Loaded!"
- GUI version: "ü¶¶ Otter Client 4.18"
- Module name: "OtterAura" (not Killaura)

====================
‚ö†Ô∏è WHY THIS HAPPENS:
====================

The script caches files locally to load faster. If you had the old version,
those cached files are still being used. Deleting the "newvape" folder forces
it to download fresh files from your new Otter Client repository.
