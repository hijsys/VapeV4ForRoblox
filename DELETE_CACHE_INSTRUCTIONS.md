# 🚨 WHY YOU'RE STILL SEEING VAPE V4 🚨

## ✅ The Code IS Updated on GitHub!
I just verified - all changes are LIVE. The problem is **YOUR CACHED FILES**.

---

## 🗑️ DELETE YOUR CACHE FOLDER - STEP BY STEP:

### **For Windows:**

1. **Close Roblox COMPLETELY** (check Task Manager to be sure)
2. Open your executor folder (where your executor .exe is)
3. Look for a folder called **`newvape`** or **`workspace`**
4. **DELETE IT** completely
5. Empty your Recycle Bin
6. Reopen Roblox
7. Execute this loadstring:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hijsys/VapeV4ForRoblox/main/NewMainScript.lua", true))()
```

### **Common Cache Locations:**

Depending on your executor, the cache might be in:
- `C:\Users\YourName\YourExecutor\newvape` 
- `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\YourExecutor\newvape`
- Inside your executor's folder: `workspace\newvape`
- Your executor's main folder: `newvape`

---

## 🔍 How to Find It:

1. Open your executor
2. Execute this code FIRST (before the loadstring):

```lua
print(isfolder("newvape"))
if isfolder("newvape") then
    delfolder("newvape")
    print("✅ Deleted cache! Now run the loadstring again.")
else
    print("❌ No cache found - run loadstring normally")
end
```

3. Then run the Otter Client loadstring

## ✅ Verification - The Code IS LIVE:

I just checked GitHub directly:
- ✅ `guis/new.lua` says "🦦 Otter Client"
- ✅ `main.lua` says "🦦 Otter Client Loaded!"
- ✅ `games/universal.lua` has "OtterAura"
- ✅ All 340b27d commit changes are LIVE

**The issue is 100% your cached files!**

---

## 🎯 Quick Fix Code:

Run this BEFORE your loadstring:

```lua
-- Delete cache
if delfolder then
    pcall(function() delfolder("newvape") end)
    wait(1)
end

-- Now load Otter Client
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hijsys/VapeV4ForRoblox/main/NewMainScript.lua", true))()
```

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT:

Roblox/your executor caches files in the `newvape` folder to load faster. 
When you had old Vape V4, those files got cached.
Even though GitHub has new files, your executor uses the cached ones.

**You MUST delete the cache to see Otter Client!**
