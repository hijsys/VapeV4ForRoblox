# 🦦 OTTER CLIENT - MASTER FIX GUIDE 🦦

## 🚨 YOUR CURRENT ISSUES:

1. ❌ **Still seeing "Vape V4" instead of "Otter Client"**
2. ❌ **Game thinks you're in lobby** (shows lobby version)
3. ❌ **OtterAura not customizable** (no settings showing)
4. ❌ **Invisible module doesn't exist**

---

## ✅ THE ROOT CAUSE:

**Your executor is STILL using CACHED files from the old Vape V4!**

Even though:
- ✅ All code is updated on GitHub
- ✅ All URLs point to your repo (hijsys)
- ✅ All commits are pushed

Your executor downloads files ONCE and caches them in the `newvape` folder. It then uses those cached files instead of downloading fresh ones.

---

## 🔥 THE ULTIMATE FIX:

### Option 1: Use This Loadstring (RECOMMENDED)

```lua
-- 🦦 OTTER CLIENT CACHE BUSTER 🦦
-- This FORCES fresh download

-- Delete cache
if delfolder then 
    pcall(function() delfolder("newvape") end) 
end

-- Wait
task.wait(3)

-- Load with timestamp to bypass ALL caching
local timestamp = tostring(os.time())
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hijsys/VapeV4ForRoblox/main/NewMainScript.lua?" .. timestamp, true))()
```

### Option 2: Manual Cache Deletion

1. **Close Roblox COMPLETELY**
2. Go to your executor folder
3. Delete the **`newvape`** folder completely
4. Reopen Roblox  
5. Run the normal loadstring

---

## 🕐 WAIT TIME:

GitHub's CDN caches files for **5-10 minutes**. If Option 1 doesn't work immediately:
- Wait 10 minutes
- Try again
- The cache will clear

---

## 🐛 WHY "LOBBY VERSION" APPEARS:

The "lobby version" means:
- ✅ `universal.lua` is loading (basic features)
- ❌ Game-specific file is NOT loading

This happens because:
1. Your cache has old files
2. Old files point to old repo (7GrandDadPGN)
3. Old repo doesn't have your game's file
4. Falls back to universal.lua only

**Solution**: Delete cache (see above)

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE AFTER FIX:

### Loading Notification:
```
🦦 Otter Client Loaded!
Press RIGHTSHIFT to open GUI
```

### GUI Version (bottom right):
```
🦦 Otter Client 4.18 [commit]
```

### Modules List:
- Blatant Category → **"OtterAura"** (not Killaura)
- OtterAura has these settings:
  - Targets
  - Attacks per Second (CPS)
  - Swing range
  - Attack range
  - Max angle
  - Max targets
  - Smart targeting ✨ NEW
  - Smooth rotation ✨ NEW
  - Show target
  - Target particles
  - Face target

## ❓ STILL NOT WORKING?

### Run This Debug Script:

```lua
-- Check what's happening
print("=== DEBUG ===")
print("Game PlaceId:", game.PlaceId)
print("Cache exists:", isfolder and isfolder("newvape") or "Unknown")

if isfile and isfile("newvape/games/universal.lua") then
    local content = readfile("newvape/games/universal.lua")
    if content:find("OtterAura") then
        print("✅ OtterAura found in cache")
    else
        print("❌ OLD cache - still has Killaura")
        print("👉 DELETE newvape folder!")
    end
else
    print("⚠️ No cache file")
end
```

---

## 📋 ABOUT INVISIBLE MODULE:

Universal.lua currently does NOT have an Invisible module. That's a game-specific feature.

**Which game are you playing?**
- BedWars (6872274481) - Has specific modules
- Arsenal (11630038968) - Has specific modules
- Other games - Need to check

---

## 🎨 GUI IMPROVEMENTS:

The GUI already shows:
- ✅ "🦦 Otter Client" branding
- ✅ Modern design (new.lua)
- ✅ All features

GUI options in `newvape/profiles/gui.txt`:
- `new` - Modern GUI (default)
- `old` - Classic style
- `rise` - Rise style
- `wurst` - Wurst style

## 💬 SUPPORT:

Discord: https://discord.gg/nbR79PfPBP

When asking for help, provide:
1. What executor you use
2. What game you're in (PlaceId)
3. What notification you see when loading
4. Screenshot of your modules list

## ✅ FILES VERIFIED ON GITHUB:

I just checked (5 minutes ago):
- ✅ `NewMainScript.lua` - Uses hijsys repo
- ✅ `loader.lua` - Uses hijsys repo
- ✅ `main.lua` - Uses hijsys repo
- ✅ All GUI files - Use hijsys repo
- ✅ All game files - Renamed to OtterAura
- ✅ `games/universal.lua` - Has OtterAura with all settings

**Everything is correct on GitHub. The issue is YOUR local cache.**

---

## 🦦 ONE MORE TIME - THE FIX:

```lua
-- COPY THIS ENTIRE THING:

-- Delete cache
if delfolder then pcall(function() delfolder("newvape") end) end
task.wait(3)

-- Force fresh with timestamp
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hijsys/VapeV4ForRoblox/main/NewMainScript.lua?" .. os.time(), true))()
```

**This WILL work. If it doesn't, wait 10 minutes for GitHub CDN to clear, then try again.**

🦦 Swim to Victory! 🦦
