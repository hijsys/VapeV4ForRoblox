ðŸ¦¦ ADDING INVISIBLE MODULE TO OTTER CLIENT ðŸ¦¦

I'll add a fully functional Invisible module to universal.lua that:
âœ… Makes your character invisible to other players
âœ… Toggleable on/off
âœ… Works in all games
âœ… Has customization options

This will be inserted after the OtterAura module definition.

The Invisible module will:
- Hide your character model
- Make you appear invisible to others
- Keep you visible to yourself (so you can see what you're doing)
- Option to hide accessories
- Option to hide tools

Adding this now...
